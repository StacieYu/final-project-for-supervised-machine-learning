# Water Potability Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview

This project investigates the application of supervised machine learning techniques to predict whether water is safe for human consumption based on a set of physicochemical features. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes variables such as pH, hardness, solids, sulfate, and trihalomethanes.

The presentation explores:

- The real-world importance of water safety prediction
- Dataset characteristics and challenges (e.g., class imbalance)
- Baseline and advanced machine learning models
- Evaluation metrics beyond accuracy (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Recommendations and next steps for future deployment

## Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Tuned Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost

## Highlights

- **Best Overall Accuracy**: XGBoost and Tuned Gradient Boosting
- **Best Balanced Performance**: SVM and Random Forest
- **Key Challenge**: Low recall for potable water due to class imbalance
- **Next Steps**: SMOTE, cost-sensitive learning, and deployment strategies
